<h2>Literate Programming</h2>
I was an early supporter of the LiteratePrograms website, en.literateprograms.org.  I was user 
"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071107115630/http://en.literateprograms.org/User:RossPatterson">RossPatterson</a>",
active around 2007.  LiteratePrograms got lost around 2010, and was recreated later, without any wiki features and with no history.
Luckily, the Internet Archive captures everything.

I created several programs there:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100710000500/http://en.literateprograms.org/Hello_World_%28Rexx%29">"Hello World" in Rexx</a></li>

</ul>
	
<h2>CruiseControl.net</h2>
(now at <a href="https://ccnet.github.io/CruiseControl.NET/projects/ccnet/wiki.html">https://ccnet.github.io/CruiseControl.NET/projects/ccnet/wiki.html</a>)
Circa 2008, I was the release manager, I think for release 1.3.  I created the

<h2>John Fisher's wonderful VMARC utility</h2>
I was part of the VM/CMS systems programming community for years during the last century, and I did some work to make <a href="https://github.com/RossPatterson/VMARC">John Fisher's wonderful VMARC utility</a> more reliably Y2K compliant.
